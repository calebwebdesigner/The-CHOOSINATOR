**What TF is this?**

It's a wee responsive web app I threw together to help bring a resolution to those moments when there's just too many options, and you just can't choose.

Got too many dining options? Too many good movies or games you want to blast through? Too many places to visit and things to do? Sick of arguing over who gets what? Or maybe you're just shit at deciding what to do? Well, the CHOOSINATOR is here to help!

Just manually type up a list or upload a .txt file (in a list format), and the CHOOSINATOR will do the choosing for you!


**Why tho?**

Tbh, I just wanted to make something that'll help me choose things in a fun way. Sometimes a little spontaneity can be added by letting the universe decide. Also, I just felt like making something to practice my HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
